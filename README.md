# programming-in-haskell

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises of [Programming In
Haskell](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pih.html) by Graham Hutton.

As I explained in [Learning
Haskell](https://manuel-uberti.github.io/programming/2017/12/08/learninghaskell/),
I set *Programming in Haskell* aside and preferred the approach of [Haskell
Programming From First Principles](http://haskellbook.com/). Thus consider this
repository my first, failed attempt at learning Haskell.
